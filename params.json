Refusing to compromise and use Word?_\r\n\r\nMeet [markdown-cv](http://elipapa.github.io/markdown-cv), a simple template to list all your accomplishments in a readable [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) file and use CSS to style it. \r\n\r\n### Instructions\r\n\r\nTo start, simply fork the repository and **type your skills, jobs and education in the `index.md` file**. \r\n\r\nThen let your local installation of [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) or [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) do the work of transforming your plain text CV into a beautiful looking HTML page. \r\n**Type `jekyll serve` and you'll be able to see your CV on your local host.**\r\n\r\nGo to the page with your favourite browser and **to get a PDF, just press print**. Print and web [CSS media queries](http://www.alistapart.com/articles/goingtoprint/) should take care of the styling.\r\n\r\nThe included CSS renders CV in a style inspired by [kjhealy's vita template](http://kjhealy.github.com/kjh-vita/), but any styling is possible. Contributions and forks are welcome! \r\n",
